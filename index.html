				<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Actor Bill Murray is a comedy icon best known for his popular 'Saturday Night Live' characters and movie classics such as 'Meatballs,' 'Caddyshack' and 'Ghostbusters.' He was nominated for an Oscar for his seriocomic role in 'Lost in Translation.'</p>

			<h3>Early Life</h3>
			<p>Actor and comedian Bill Murray was born William J. Murray on September 21, 1950, in Wilmette, Illinois. The fifth of nine children, Murray was a self-proclaimed troublemaker, whether it was getting kicked out of Little League or being arrested at age 20 for attempting to smuggle close to nine pounds of marijuana through Chicago's O'Hare Airport. In an attempt to find direction in his life, he joined his older brother, Brian Doyle-Murray, in the cast of Chicago's Second City improvisational comedy troupe.</p>

			<h3>'Saturday Night Live'</h3>
			<p>He eventually relocated to New York City, where he took his comedic talents on air in the radio show National Lampoon Hour (1973-74) alongside Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner and John Belushi. In 1975, both Murray brothers were in an off-Broadway spin-off of the radio show when Bill was spotted by sportscaster Howard Cosell, who recruited him for the cast of his ABC variety program Saturday Night Live With Howard Cosell (1975-76). On NBC, a program also named Saturday Night Live (1975- ) was creating a much bigger sensation. A year later, producer Lorne Michaels tapped Murray to replace Chevy Chase, who had moved on to pursue a film career.</p>
			<p>It was on the set of Saturday Night Live that Murray created the sleazy, insincere comedic character that became his calling card for many films to come. He also earned an Emmy award for Outstanding Writing for his work on the show. It didn't take long for Murray to move from the small screen to the big screen, and his first major film role was in the 1979 box office hit Meatballs. This was followed by the biographical flop Where the Buffalo Roam (1980), in which Murray starred as gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson.</p>

			<h3>Blockbusters &amp; Hiatus</h3>
			<p>Murray redeemed himself later that year by going back to his comedic roots with the cult classic Caddyshack. He continued with a string of successes on film, such as in the army farce Stripes (1981), Tootsie (1982) and Ghostbusters (1984), the latter of which co-starred Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. The comedy was one of the decade's biggest hits, earning almost $300 million worldwide and spawning a sequel, a cartoon series, action figures and even a chart-topping theme song.</p>
			<p>Murray's next move caught loyal fans off guard. He starred in and co-wrote an adaptation of the Somerset Maugham novel The Razor's Edge in 1984, which had been a lifelong dream. The hairpin turn from farce to literary drama proved too sharp, and the film was a failure. Murray spent the next several years away from Hollywood, only making a cameo appearance in the 1986 musical comedy Little Shop of Horrors.</p>

			<h3>'Tenenbaums' and 'Translation'</h3>
			<p>In 1998, Murray played what many believed to be one of his finest roles in Wes Anderson's Rushmore. As a business tycoon competing with an eccentric 15-year-old for the affections of a first grade teacher, Murray won Best Supporting Actor from both the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics. The film's success helped put the actor back at the forefront, and Murray was added to Anderson's stable of go-to actors. Murray drew further exposure that year from his appearance as a sleazy lawyer in the controversial Wild Things.</p>
			<p>In 1999, he appeared in Tim Robbins's Cradle Will Rock and in 2000 he played the affably dense Bosley in the Charlie's Angels remake. In 2001, he once again gained critical praise for his role in Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums. In 2003, Murray signed on to voice Garfield in Fox's live-action adaptation of the comic-strip feline and teamed up yet again with director Anderson for the offbeat comedy The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004). The same year, Murray received an Academy Award nomination for his starring role in Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation (2003).</p>
			<p>For his next performance, Murray made a cameo in the Anderson film The Darjeeling Limited (2007), following that with starring turns in the comedy film Get Smart and the children's adventure film City of Ember (2008). In 2009, continuing his work in the realm of dramas, he starred in Jim Jarmusch's The Limits of Control.

The film follows Roosevelt's relationship with his distant cousin and confidante Margaret Stuckley (Laura Linney). He also reunited with Anderson for a role in Moonrise Kingdom that same year. </p>
			<p>Murray was also in Anderson's next film, The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) with Jude Law and Ralph Fiennes, as well as The Monuments Men (2014) with George Clooney, Matt Damon and John Goodman. Murray was also nominated for a lead actor Golden Globe for his role in the comedy St. Vincent (2014), co-starring Melissa McCarthy and Naomi Watts. That same year he starred as Jack Kennison in the acclaimed HBO miniseries Olive Kitteridge, for which he earned his second Emmy Award.
